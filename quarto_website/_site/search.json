    "text": "Hi! I’m Riya.I have 3+ years of experience in the field of data science. Apart from doing my undergraduate and currently my master’s in data science, I’ve worked on numerous projects in data science, covering image processing, computer vision, machine learning models and deep learning concepts. I’m fairly confident making Tensorflow pipelines and creating reproducible machine learning models. My expertise lies in simplifying complex topics as I have a passion for teaching; and to be a good teacher, you need to be an excellent learner. Over the last 8 months, I’ve completed numerous Google courses, completing the “Machine Learning on Google Cloud” and “Advanced Machine Learning on Google Cloud” specializations. I plan to get ML on Cloud certified once I graduate from my master’s program."
